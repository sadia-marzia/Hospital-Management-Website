                <p>Colds and influenza (flu) are the most common illnesses among college students. </p>
                <p class="topic">Causes</p>
                <p>Both of these illnesses are upper respiratory infections, meaning they involve your nose, throat, and lungs. Viruses cause both colds and flu by increasing inflammation of the membranes in the nose and throat.</p>
                <p> Most transmission of these viruses occurs via hand-to-hand contact.</p>
                <p class="topic">Symptomps</p>
                <p>Flu symptoms come on suddenly and affect the body all over. Flu symptoms are usually more serious than a cold and include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>fever (100° F)</li>
                    <li>headache</li>   
                    <li>more intense pain and fatigue</li>  
                    <li>more severe, often dry cough</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may also experience a mild headache, body aches or a low grade fever. Typically, a cold lasts 2-14 days.</p>
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>If any problem is causing you discomfort, you should seek medical care.Seek medical attention promptly if you have: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a fever of 102° F or greater (which may indicate a more serious infection)</li>
                    <li>a persisting cough, especially with a significant fever (which could indicate pneumonia)</li>
                    <li>a persistent sore throat (especially if runny nose does not develop - which could indicate a strep infection)</li>
                    <li>any cold lasting more than 10 days</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Prevention</p>
                <p>The flu is probably only contagious during the first three days of illness, and the incubation period is 24-72 hours, meaning you might not show symptoms for three days after contracting the virus. It is rare to catch a cold virus through the air – most transmission occurs via hand-to-hand contact. To prevent colds, flu, and other illnesses, follow these tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands often (which is good advice for keeping healthy in any situation). Keep them away from your nose, eyes, and mouth. Use an instant hand sanitizer when you can’t wash your hands.</li>
                    <li>Get regular exercise and eat well.</li>
                    <li>Follow good sleep habits.</li>
                    <li>Get a flu shot each fall (offered to all students at a lower cost by UHS each fall) </li>

                </ul>

            <h1><span id="pinkeye">Conjunctivitis </span></h1>
            <div id="des">
                <p class="topic">Causes</p>
                <p>Conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the transparent membrane (conjunctiva) that lines your eyelids and part of your eyeballs, has several possible causes. It could be a bacterial or viral infection, an allergic reaction to pollen or animal dander, or a result of chemical irritants (smoke, chlorine, lens solution, etc.).</p>
                <p class="topic">Symptomps</p>
                <p>These symptoms may last a few hours to several weeks: redness, itching, tearing, burning sensation, pus-like discharge and/or crusting of the eyelids. Because conjunctivitis causes inflammation of the small blood vessels in the conjunctiva to become more prominent, the whites of your eyes will appear pink or red. When you wake you are likely to feel that your eyelids are pasted shut, and your vision may not be as clear as usual.</p>
                
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>Because pink eye is highly contagious, early diagnosis is important. Bacterial cases can be cured with antibiotic eye drops, viral conjunctivitis clears up on its own, and allergic reactions can be treated with various types of eye drops. Here are some general tips: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands frequently to prevent spreading an existing infection to your other eye, and to other people.</li>
                    <li>Don’t rub your eyes.</li>
                    <li>Use a cool wet washcloth to soak off any crusting</li>
                    <li>Use a warm or cool compress to reduce discomfort.</li>
                    <li>Discard eye make-up because it may cause future infection.</li>
                    <li>Wash any clothing that may be contaminated, including towels and pillowcases. Try to use clean towels and pillowcases everyday.</li>
                    <li>Avoid wearing contact lenses and discard current lenses.</li>
                    <li>If eye drops are prescribed, place drop in pocket formed by pulling down lower lid. Make sure you don’t touch the bottle to the eye in order to prevent contamination.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Prevention</p>
                <p>Pink eye is extremely contagious, so if you know someone who is infected, make sure you do not expose yourself to contact with the person’s eye fluid. The infection can easily be passed via keyboards, doorknobs, make-up, pens, gym equipment, and a vast number of other items. To protect yourself, wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, and wash anything that may be contaminated.</p>

                </ul>
                
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>Usually diarrhea will clear up on its own in a day or two, but a prolonged case may cause complications. The most important concern is dehydration. If you have symptoms of dehydration, a fever above 102° F, bloody stools (black and tarry), severe abdomen or rectum pain, or diarrhea lasting more than 3 days you should consult a physician. Here’s some advice for taking care of diarrhea yourself: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid foods that are milk-based, greasy, high-fiber, or very sweet because these are likely to aggravate diarrhea.</li>
                    <li>Do not eat solid food if you have signs of dehydration (thirst, light-headed, dark urine). Instead, drink about 2 cups of clear fluids per hour (if vomiting isn’t present), such as sports drinks and broth. Water alone is not enough because your body needs sodium and sugar to replace what it’s losing.</li>
                    <li>Avoid high sugar drinks, like apple juice, grape juice, and soda, which can pull water into the intestine and make the diarrhea persist.</li>
                    <li>Over-the-counter drugs, such as Imodium A-D, should only be used if absolutely necessary because it is important to let diarrhea flush out the bacteria or parasite that’s causing the infection.</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="des">
                
                <p>Everyone suffers the occasional mild headache, but if you experience debilitating pain and/or abnormally frequent headaches, you probably want to find relief. There are countless causes of headaches, which differ for each person, so you’ll have to do some experimenting to figure out the cause of your pain. Fortunately, the vast majority of headaches are primary headaches, not the result of underlying medical conditions. The three most common types are cluster, tension-type, and migraine. </p>
                <br>
                <p>A cluster headache affects a specific point of the head, often the eye, and is characterized by sharp, piercing pain. Migraine and tension-type headaches are far more common. “Tension“ headaches are now called “tension-type“ headaches because pain is not only caused by stress, but also poor posture, depression, and even sexual activity. In fact, recent studies have shown a connection between low serotonin levels and so-called “tension“ headaches.</p>
                <p class="topic">Causes</p>
                <p>The cause of a headache is often elusive. Although it may seem that your head is pounding for no reason, there is always an explanation for pain. To find out the cause of your headaches, keep a log. Write down the date and time each headache starts and stops, the location of the pain, the nature and severity of the pain, and any factors that seem to trigger the headaches (food, stress, menstrual cycle, medicine, etc.).</p>
                <p> Some of the many causes of headaches:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Emotional and physical stress, Fatigue ,Irregular sleep habits (sleeping too much or too little)</li>
                    <li>Skipping meals, Caffeine use or withdrawal,Hormonal factors, such as menstruation</li>
                    <li>Monosodium glutamate (MSG),Foods with nitrates, such as hot dogs</li>
                    <li>Alcohol,Some medicines</li>
                    <li>Certain foods, including red wine, chocolate, aged cheeses, pickled foods, nuts, and aspartame</li>
                    <li>Changes in weather, altitude, or time zone</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Symptomps</p>
                <p>Just as the causes vary for each headache sufferer, so do the symptoms and severity of pain. Health professionals can often diagnose the type of headache you suffer based on your symptoms.Symptoms of a migraine:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>pulsing or throbbing quality</li>
                    <li>begins with intense pain on one side of the head, which eventually spreads</li>   
                    <li>felt on one or both sides of the head</li>  
                    <li>ometimes preceded by visual changes, such as an aura of zigzag lines or flashes of light</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Ice pack held over the eyes or forehead</li>
                    <li>Taking breaks from stressful situations</li>
                    <li>Regular exercise to increase endorphin levels and relax muscles. Even if you already have a headache, exercising may relieve the pain. However, intense exercise may bring on a headache.</li>
                    <li>Prescription drugs for severe headaches</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Prevention</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be aware of early symptoms so you can try to stop the headache as soon as it begins.</li>
                    <li>Don’t smoke, and if you do, quit.</li>
                    <li>Cut down on caffeine and alcohol (reduce caffeine intake gradually because withdrawal may cause headaches).</li>

                <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy. </p>

                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump, frequent blood sugar checks, and carbohydrate counting. For some people with type 1 diabetes, pancreas transplant or islet cell transplant may be an option.</p><br>
                <p>Treatment of type 2 diabetes mostly involves lifestyle changes, monitoring of your blood sugar, along with oral diabetes drugs, insulin or both.</p>
                <p><b>Monitoring your blood sugar</b></p>
                <p>Depending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar as many as four times a day or more often if you're taking insulin. Careful blood sugar testing is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. People with type 2 diabetes who aren't taking insulin generally check their blood sugar much less often.</p><br>
                <p>People who receive insulin therapy also may choose to monitor their blood sugar levels with a continuous glucose monitor. Although this technology hasn't yet completely replaced the glucose meter, it can lower the number of fingersticks necessary to check blood sugar and provide important information about trends in blood sugar levels.</p>
                <p><b>Insulin</b></p>
                <p>People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin to manage blood sugar to survive. Many people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes also need insulin therapy.Many types of insulin are available, including short-acting (regular insulin), rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. Depending on your needs, your provider may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use during the day and night.Insulin can't be taken orally to lower blood sugar because stomach enzymes interfere with insulin's action. Insulin is often injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen — a device that looks like a large ink pen.</p>
                <p><b>Oral or other drugs</b></p>
                <p>Sometimes your provider may prescribe other oral or injected drugs as well. Some diabetes drugs help your pancreas to release more insulin. Others prevent the production and release of glucose from your liver, which means you need less insulin to move sugar into your cells.Still others block the action of stomach or intestinal enzymes that break down carbohydrates, slowing their absorption, or make your tissues more sensitive to insulin. Metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) is generally the first drug prescribed for type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <div id="des">
                
                <p> High blood pressure is a common condition that affects the body's arteries. It's also called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high. The heart has to work harder to pump blood.</p><br>
                <p>Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, hypertension is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 mm Hg or higher.</p><br>
                
                <p class="topic">Causes</p>
                <p>Blood pressure is determined by two things: the amount of blood the heart pumps and how hard it is for the blood to move through the arteries. The more blood the heart pumps and the narrower the arteries, the higher the blood pressure.</p>
                <br>
                <p>There are two main types of high blood pressure.</p>
                <p><b>Primary hypertension, also called essential hypertension</b></p>
                <p>For most adults, there's no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure is called primary hypertension or essential hypertension. It tends to develop gradually over many years. Plaque buildup in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, increases the risk of high blood pressure.</p>
                <p><b>Secondary hypertension</b></p>
                <p>This type of high blood pressure is caused by an underlying condition. It tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Conditions and medicines that can lead to secondary hypertension include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adrenal gland tumors</li>
                    <li>Blood vessel problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects</li>
                    <li>Cough and cold medicines, some pain relievers, birth control pills, and other prescription drugs</li>
                    <li>Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines</li>
                    <li>Kidney disease</li>
                    <li>Thyroid problems</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Symptomps</p>
                <p>Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms.A few people with high blood pressure may have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Headaches</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>   
                    <li>Nosebleeds</li>  
                </ul>
                <p>However, these symptoms aren't specific. They usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.</p>
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>The type of medicine used to treat hypertension depends on your overall health and how high your blood pressure is. Two or more blood pressure drugs often work better than one. It can take some time to find the medicine or combination of medicines that works best for you.</p><br>
                <p>Medicines used to treat high blood pressure include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Water pills (diuretics).</li>
                    <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. </li>
                    <li>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).</li>
                    <li>Alpha blockers.</li>
                    <li>Beta blockers.</li>
                    <li>Central-acting agents. </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="topic">Prevention</p>
                <p> Changing your lifestyle can help control and manage high blood pressure. Your health care provider may recommend that you make lifestyle changes including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating a heart-healthy diet with less salt</li>
                    <li>Getting regular physical activity</li>
                    <li>Maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight</li>
                    <li>Getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily</li>

                <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection that usually attacks your lungs. It can also spread to other parts of your body, like your brain and spine.  </p>
                <p class="topic">Causes</p>
                <p>Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread through the air, just like a cold or the flu. You can get TB only if you come into contact with people who have it.</p>
                
                <p class="topic">Symptomps</p>
                <p>Latent TB doesn’t have symptoms. A skin or blood test can tell if you have it. Signs of active TB disease include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A cough that lasts more than 3 weeks</li>
                    <li>Chest pain</li>   
                    <li>Coughing up blood</li>  
                    <li>Feeling tired all the time</li>
                    <li>Night sweats</li>

                </ul>
                <p>If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor to get tested. Get medical help right away if you have chest pain.</p>
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>Your treatment will depend on your infection. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have latent TB, your doctor will give you medication to kill the bacteria so the infection doesn’t become active. You might get isoniazid, rifapentine, or rifampin, either alone or combined. You’ll have to take the drugs for up to 9 months. If you see any signs of active TB, call your doctor right away.</li>
                    <li>A combination of medicines also treats active TB. The most common are ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. You’ll take them for 6 to 12 months.</li>
                    <li>If you have drug-resistant TB, your doctor might give you one or more different medicines. You may have to take them for much longer, up to 30 months, and they can cause more side effects.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Prevention</p>
                <p>To help stop the spread of TB:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a latent infection, take all of your medication so it doesn’t become active and contagious.</li>
                    <li>If you have active TB, limit your contact with other people. Cover your mouth when you laugh, sneeze, or cough. Wear a surgical mask when you’re around other people during the first weeks of treatment.</li>
                    <li>If you’re traveling to a place where TB is common, avoid spending a lot of time in crowded places with sick people.</li>

            <div id="des">
                
                <p>A stroke is a medical emergency, and prompt treatment is crucial. Early action can reduce brain damage and other complications.</p>
                <p class="topic">Causes</p>
                <p>There are two main causes of stroke: a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), that doesn't cause lasting symptoms.</p>
                <p class="topic">Symptomps</p>
                <p>If you or someone you're with may be having a stroke, pay particular attention to the time the symptoms began. Some treatment options are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins.Signs and symptoms of stroke include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying.</b> You may experience confusion, slur words or have difficulty understanding speech.</li>
                    <li><b>Paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg.</b> You may develop sudden numbness, weakness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg. This often affects just one side of the body. Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time. If one arm begins to fall, you may be having a stroke. Also, one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile.</li>   
                    <li><b>Problems seeing in one or both eyes. </b>You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes, or you may see double.</li>  
                    <li><b>Headache.</b>A sudden, severe headache, which may be accompanied by vomiting, dizziness or altered consciousness, may indicate that you're having a stroke.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="topic">Treatment</p>
                <p>Emergency treatment for stroke depends on whether you're having an ischemic stroke or a stroke that involves bleeding into the brain (hemorrhagic). </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Emergency IV medication.</b> Therapy with drugs that can break up a clot has to be given within 4.5 hours from when symptoms first started if given intravenously. The sooner these drugs are given, the better. Quick treatment not only improves your chances of survival but also may reduce complications. An IV injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) — also called alteplase (Activase) or tenecteplase (TNKase) — is the gold standard treatment for ischemic stroke. An injection of TPA is usually given through a vein in the arm within the first three hours. Sometimes, TPA can be given up to 4.5 hours after stroke symptoms started.</li>
                    <li><b>Emergency endovascular procedures.</b> Doctors sometimes treat ischemic strokes directly inside the blocked blood vessel. Endovascular therapy has been shown to significantly improve outcomes and reduce long-term disability after ischemic stroke.</li>
                    <li><b>Carotid endarterectomy.</b> Carotid arteries are the blood vessels that run along each side of the neck, supplying the brain (carotid arteries) with blood. This surgery removes the plaque blocking a carotid artery and may reduce the risk of ischemic stroke. A carotid endarterectomy also involves risks, especially for people with heart disease or other medical conditions.</li>
                    <li><b>Surgery.</b> If the area of bleeding is large, your doctor may perform surgery to remove the blood and relieve pressure on the brain. Surgery may also be used to repair blood vessel problems associated with hemorrhagic strokes. Your doctor may recommend one of these procedures after a stroke or if an aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or other type of blood vessel problem caused the hemorrhagic stroke.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="topic">Prevention</p>
                <p>You can help prevent stroke by making healthy choices and controlling any health conditions you may have.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Healthy living . </b>Many strokes could be prevented through healthy lifestyle changes and working with your health care team to control health conditions that raise your risk for stroke.You can help prevent stroke by making healthy lifestyle choices.</li>
                    <li><b>Choose healthy foods and drinks. </b>
                    Choosing healthy meal and snack options can help you prevent stroke. Be sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.Eating foods low in saturated fats, trans fat, and cholesterol and high in fiber can help prevent high cholesterol. Limiting salt (sodium) in your diet can also lower your blood pressure. High cholesterol and high blood pressure increase your chances of having a stroke.</li>
                    <li><b>Keep a healthy weight.</b>Having overweight or obesity increases your risk for stroke. To determine whether your weight is in a healthy range, doctors often calculate your body mass index (BMI). If you know your weight and height, you can calculate your BMI at CDC’s Assessing Your Weight website. Doctors sometimes also use waist and hip measurements to measure excess body fat.</li>
                    <li><b>Don’t smoke.</b>
                    Cigarette smoking greatly increases your chances of having a stroke. If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk for stroke. Your doctor can suggest ways to help you quit.</li>
                    <li><b>Limit alcohol.</b>Avoid drinking too much alcohol, which can raise your blood pressure. Men should have no more than two drinks per day, and women should have no more than one per day. </li>
                    <li><b>Control your medical conditions.</b>Talk with your doctor about steps you can take to lower your risk for stroke. If you have heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, you can take steps to lower your risk for stroke.</li>
                    <li><b>Check cholesterol.</b>Your doctor should test your cholesterol levels at least once every 5 years. Talk with your health care team about this simple blood test. If you have high cholesterol, medicine and lifestyle changes can help lower your risk for stroke.</li>
                    <li><b>Control blood pressure.</b>High blood pressure usually has no symptoms, so be sure to have it checked on a regular basis. Talk to your health care team about how often you should check your levels. You can check your blood pressure at home, at a doctor’s office, or at a pharmacy.</li>
                    <li><b>Control diabetes. </b>If your doctor thinks you have symptoms of diabetes, he or she may recommend that you get tested. If you have diabetes, check your blood sugar levels regularly. Talk with your health care team about treatment options. Your doctor may recommend certain lifestyle changes, such as getting more physical activity or choosing healthier foods. These actions will help keep your blood sugar under good control and help lower your risk for stroke.</li>

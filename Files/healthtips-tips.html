        <p>Many people get active to improve overall health, build muscle, and of course, get a killer bod, but working out has above-the-neck benefits, too. For the past decade or so, scientists have pondered exercise and nutrition can boost overall health. Regardless of age or fitness level, studies show that making time for exercise and adjusting your diet provides some serious mental benefits. In this post, we’ll talk about tips on how to take care of our bodies; both our physical and mental well-being. Remember, it’s important to turn healthy behaviors into habits – practice these tips regularly to make them part of your lifestyle.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Exercise</h1>
        <p>Exercise has numerous benefits, including improving heart health to reduce the risk of heart disease, and mental health by reducing anxiety and depression by improving self-esteem and cognitive function.The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic exercise (blue and green zones with your Myzone heart rate monitor) or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic exercise (yellow and red zones with your Myzone heart rate monitor), or a combination of the two. We can easily meet these goals by exercising for 30 minutes per day, five days per week. </p><br>
        <p>Examples of aerobic exercise include running, rowing, cycling, swimming, walking, hiking, and dancing. Use your Myzone heart rate monitor to gauge the intensity to ensure that you’re following the recommendations for heart health.</p>
        <h1>Choose a Healthy Nutrition Routine</h1>
        <p>Here are some specific recommendations on eating for a healthy body and mind:</p>
        <div id="sub-sec">
            <h4>Control Your Portion Sizes.</h4>
            <p>Fill the majority of your plate with colorful nutrient-rich, low-calorie foods, such as fruits and vegetables.</p><br>
            <p>Be realistic about how much food you’ll actually need to feel full – our eyes can get the best of us, especially when we’re at a buffet or when we’re using larger plates. You probably don’t need as much as your eyes tell you.</p>
            <h4>Load Up on Vegetables and Fruits.</h4>
            <p>Just be sure to limit the ones that are fried, covered in thick sauces, or canned in heavy syrups.</p>
            <h4>Select Whole, Fiber-Rich Grains.</h4>
            <p>Examples include whole-wheat or whole-grain bread, brown rice, oatmeal, barley, and buckwheat.A simple rule is to look for “whole” as the first word on the ingredients list. Even food items labeled as “wheat” may not be “whole wheat” unless designated as such.</p>
            <h4>Limit Your Sodium Intake.</h4>
            <p>Excess sodium contributes to high blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The AHA recommends a goal of 1,500 mg of sodium per day or less. Packaged and processed food may have surprisingly high sodium content, so make sure most of your food is fresh and unprocessed.</p>
            <h4>Limit Unhealthy Fats.</h4>
            <p>Saturated and trans fats can raise your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increase your risk for unwanted disease. To avoid these fats, limit your intake of pastries, red meat, processed meats, and fried foods.</p>



        </div>
        
        
        <h1>Minimize Stress</h1>
        <p>Stress can wreak havoc on our bodies by increasing blood pressure, and putting a strain on our body both mentally and emotionally. It also weakens our immune system and makes us more likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors, such as overeating and cigarette smoking.
        
        Some stress-fighting activities include exercising, meditating, sleeping, laughing, unplugging from technology to relax, and enjoying good conversation with friends.</p>
        

        <h1>Avoid harmful use of alcohol</h1>
        <p>There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health problems such as mental and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis, some cancers and heart diseases, as well as injuries resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.</p>


        <h1>Don’t smoke</h1>
        <p>Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills not only the direct smokers but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino adults who smoke tobacco but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit.</p><br><p>If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience immediate and long-term health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not start smoking and fight for your right to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air.</p>
        

        <h1>Check your blood pressure regularly</h1>
        <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is called a “silent killer”. This is because many people who have hypertension may not be aware of the problem as it may not have any symptoms. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. Have your blood pressure checked regularly by a health worker so you know your numbers. If your blood pressure is high, get the advice of a health worker. This is vital in the prevention and control of hypertension.</p>

        <h1>Get tested</h1>
        <p>Getting yourself tested is an important step in knowing your health status, especially when it comes to HIV, hepatitis B, sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). Left untreated, these diseases can lead to serious complications and even death. Knowing your status means you will know how to either continue preventing these diseases or, if you find out that you’re positive, get the care and treatment that you need. Go to a public or private health facility, wherever you are comfortable, to have yourself tested.</p>

        <h1>Get vaccinated</h1>
        <p>Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases. Vaccines work with your body’s natural defences to build protection against diseases like cervical cancer, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, pneumonia, polio, rabies, rubella, tetanus, typhoid, and yellow fever.</p>


        <h1> Cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing</h1>
        <p>Diseases such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis are transmitted through the air. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, infectious agents may be passed on to others through airborne droplets. When you feel a cough or sneeze coming on, make sure you have covered your mouth with a face mask or use a tissue then dispose it carefully. If you do not have a tissue close by when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth as much as possible with the crook (or the inside) of your elbow.</p>

        <h1> Prevent mosquito bites</h1>
        <p>Mosquitoes are one of the deadliest animals in the world. Diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria and lymphatic filariasis are transmitted by mosquitoes and continue to affect Filipinos. You can take simple measures to protect yourself and your loved ones against mosquito-borne diseases. If you’re traveling to an area with known mosquito-borne diseases, consult a physician for a vaccine to prevent diseases such as Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever or if you need to take antimalarial medicines. Wear light-coloured, long-sleeved shirts and pants and use insect repellent. At home, use window and door screens, use bed nets and clean your surroundings weekly to destroy mosquito breeding sites.</p>


        <h1>Drink only safe water</h1>
        <p>Drinking unsafe water can lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. Check with your water concessionaire and water refilling station to ensure that the water you’re drinking is safe. In a setting where you are unsure of your water source, boil your water for at least one minute. This will destroy harmful organisms in the water. Let it cool naturally before drinking.</p>

        <h1>Breastfeed babies from 0 to 2 years and beyond</h1>
        <p>Breastfeeding is the best way to provide the ideal food for newborns and infants. WHO recommends that mothers initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth. Breastfeeding for the first six months is crucial for the baby to grow up healthy. It is recommended that breastfeeding is continued for up to two years and beyond. Aside from being beneficial to babies, breastfeeding is also good for the mother as it reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, type II diabetes, and postpartum depression.</p>

        <h1>Talk to someone you trust if you're feeling down</h1>
        <p>Depression is a common illness worldwide with over 260 million people affected. Depression can manifest in different ways, but it might make you feel hopeless or worthless, or you might think about negative and disturbing thoughts a lot or have an overwhelming sense of pain. If you’re going through this, remember that you are not alone. Talk to someone you trust such as a family member, friend, colleague or mental health professional about how you feel. If you feel that you are in danger of harming yourself, contact the National Center for Mental Health hotline at 0917-899-USAP (8727).</p>


        <h1>Take antibiotics only as prescribed</h1>
        <p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest public health threats in our generation. When antibiotics lose their power, bacterial infections become harder to treat, leading to higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality. Antibiotics are losing their power because of misuse and overuse in humans and animals. Make sure you only take antibiotics if prescribed by a qualified health professional. And once prescribed, complete the treatment days as instructed. Never share antibiotics.</p>

        <h1>Clean your hands properly</h1>
        <p>Hand hygiene is critical not only for health workers but for everyone. Clean hands can prevent the spread of infectious illnesses. You should handwash using soap and water when your hands are visibly soiled or handrub using an alcohol-based product.</p>


        <h1>Prepare your food correctly</h1>
        <p>Unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances, causes more than 200 diseases – ranging from diarrhoea to cancers. When buying food at the market or store, check the labels or the actual produce to ensure it is safe to eat. If you are preparing food, make sure you follow the Five Keys to Safer Food:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>keep clean</li>
            <li>separate raw and cooked</li>
            <li>cook thoroughly;</li>
            <li>keep food at safe temperatures</li>
            <li>use safe water and raw materials.</li>
        </ul>


        <h1>Have regular check-ups</h1>
        <p>Regular check-ups can help find health problems before they start. Health professionals can help find and diagnose health issues early, when your chances for treatment and cure are better. Go to your nearest health facility to check out the the health services, screenings and treatment that are accessible to you.

       <p class="echo"><b>ECHOCARDIOGRAM</b> <br>An echocardiogram is a type of ultrasound diagnostic test used by doctors to:

            Assess the overall function of the heart
            Determine the presence of any heart disease
            Follow the progress of any heart valve disease
            Evaluate the effectiveness of any medical or surgical treatment
            An echocardiogram image is much more detailed than a plain x-ray, and involves no radiation exposure, thus making it much safer. Depending on what the doctor requires, a patient can expect to undergo several types of echocardiograms.</p>
      
            <p class="ecg"><b>Electrocardiogram(ECG)</b> <br>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic procedure that measures and probes for any complications or abnormalities with the electrical activity of the heart. An ECG translates the heart’s electrical activity into line tracings that doctors can use to detect abnormal heart rates and rhythms.In ECG , Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.</p>

   <p><b>What is Ultrasonography?</b> <br>Ultrasound is a safe and widely used imaging technique. Ultrasound produces detailed pictures of the body in real time using high frequency sound waves which are produced by a special ultrasound probe, called a transducer. The frequency of these sound waves is higher than that detected by the human ear and when they are reflected by a part of the body they are detected by the probe and used to create images that can be displayed on a monitor. Because they are captured in real time they appear as moving images not as static or still ones thus enhancing the diagnostic capability of the test. Ultrasound has no known harmful effects and can be used to image a variety of conditions including pregnancy, gallstones and varicose veins. Ultrasound can also be used to measure blood flow through vessels, when it is called a color flow Doppler or Duplex scan.</p>
